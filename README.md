## Ruby on Rails Set Up
- `$ rails new app_name -d postgresql -T`
- cd into the project
- Using this command to create a new Ruby on Rails app generates a base file structure
- `$ rails db:create`
- To start the server run `$ rails s`
- To display the application in the browser navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Basic Rails Info
- Ruby on Rails (or just "Rails") is a MVC server-side framework written in Ruby.
- Rails provides default code for a database, for web pages, for HTML and CSS, and actually has a little JavaScript in there as well.
- Rails is very "opinionated" and requires close adherence to naming conventions.
